# Next.js template with Tailwind CSS Integration

A simple 2 page Next.js app with an Index and About page, with a shared Navbar component. In the server folder you'll find a simple express server.

Clone the repo:
1. `git clone "repo"`  
2. `cd "repo"` to enter the cloned directory  
3. `npm install` to install required dependencies
4. `npm run dev` to start the dev server

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` and see your basic Next.js app
