# Next.js template with Tailwind CSS Integration

A simple 2 page Next.js app with an Index and About page, with a shared Navbar component. In the server folder you'll find a simple express server. Styling from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

# Getting started
1. `git clone "repo"`  
2. `cd "repo"` to enter the cloned directory

## To start the server:
3. `cd server && npm install && npm start`

## To start the client:
4. `cd client && npm install && npm run dev`

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` and see your basic Next.js app - then visit `http://localhost:5000/api/users` to verify the server is functioning.
